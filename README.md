## Technical Guide

### Overview

This is a react application with sass as a preprocessor.  It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
New Hooks features included in React 16.8 are used here.

### Project Structure

This project is modularized with components, helpers, and services taking care of requests. All components are intended to be totally isolated from each other and rehusable.

The Rating component was based on an existing one, see it [here](https://codepen.io/benjaminreid/pen/vNVwPW)
